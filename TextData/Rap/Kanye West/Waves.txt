[Intro]
Turn me up!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Step up in this bitch like (turn me up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin' on my dick like
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own...

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Sun don't shine in the shade (turn me up!)
Bird can't fly in a cage (turn me up!)
Even when somebody go away (turn me up!)
The feelings don't really go away
That's just the wave (yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
No lie
No lie
No lie
You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie

[Outro: Chris Brown & Kid Cudi]
No lie
Ooh baby, ooh baby
You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie
