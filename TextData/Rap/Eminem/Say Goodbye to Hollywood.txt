Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood! Why do I feel this way?!)
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now…

[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, ‘cause I don't wanna look
At nothin', this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
‘Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter, layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps
Of my dad, ‘cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em…

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein' everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had
Instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'…

[Outro]
Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)
