[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (hi, Marshall)
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
‘Cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world!" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back
Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
‘Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
‘Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat—gentlemen, hold your pistols!
But I form like Voltron
And blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady; Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan
 

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world!" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back
Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
‘Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
‘Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody, let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems
Got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

‘Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
