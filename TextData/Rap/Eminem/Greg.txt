[Verse: Eminem]
Met a retarded kid name Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
Fuck an acid tab, I strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited till it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I’m blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross tha bombers
We blowin' up your house, killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
