[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' a limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this!
Livin' amok, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
‘Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

[Hook]
For all the weed that I've smoked – yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended – yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have – yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done – yo, I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended – yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce – yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leaks out of your veins and bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
‘Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match ("Here, Momma, try 'em on!")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God, help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again
 

[Hook]
For all the weed that I've smoked – yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended – yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have – yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done – yo, I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended – yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce – yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women—fuck bitches!
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck! I was born during an earthquake
 

[Hook]
For all the weed that I've smoked – yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended – yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have – yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done – yo, I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended – yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce – yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
