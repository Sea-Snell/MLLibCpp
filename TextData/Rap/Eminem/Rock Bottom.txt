[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm about to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers — maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
‘Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass spineless

[Hook]
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
‘Cause you're mad enough to scream
But you're sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it — if you know the rules to the game, play!
‘Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
‘Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away
 

[Hook]
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
‘Cause you're mad enough to scream
But you're sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
If it means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flames
If it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
‘Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems — now everybody on my block's got 'em
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch — you want 'em?
‘Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn, with guns drawn
 

[Hook]
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
‘Cause you're mad enough to scream
But you're sad enough to tear
