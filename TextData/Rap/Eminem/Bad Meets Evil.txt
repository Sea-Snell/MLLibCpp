[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said...

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peakin'
On speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man
Disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords
I buried the Christ corpse, in my past life
When the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked
It's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

[Hook 1: Eminem]
‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law ‘cause I don't agree with police either
(Shit, me neither)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, ‘cause I can't find a decent vein
 

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
The disaster with dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny
Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
‘Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred
Man, until they joint chains, while slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it
Murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

[Spoken: Eminem]
Hello? Ayo, what’s up?
We’re coming to get you!
Stop! THEY KNOW IT’S US!!!

[Verse 5: Eminem]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down, well, I'm out now
And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
 

[Hook 2: Royce da 5'9"]
‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell
Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady
See you in Hell for the sequel (bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time)

[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid
Look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shhh… wait, did y'all hear that?
