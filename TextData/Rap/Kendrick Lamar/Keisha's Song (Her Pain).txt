[Hook: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 1]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only 17
The 7 cars start honking, she start running like Flo-Jo
Don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father, that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

[Verse 2]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

[Verse 3]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song
 

[Bridge]
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play
