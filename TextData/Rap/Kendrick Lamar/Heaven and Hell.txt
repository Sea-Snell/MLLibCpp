My nigga, what it look like?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'
My nigga, what it look like?
That's exactly what Hell look like

[Hook: Alori Joh]
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!

My nigga, what it look like?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin, people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being...
