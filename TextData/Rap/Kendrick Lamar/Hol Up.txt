[Verse 1]
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist
Eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him
I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with 20 bitches, 20 million
And a Comptown fitted

[Hook]
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit popping, Section.80

[Verse 2]
Back in this bitch
In the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall
And your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump-off
I call a bitch a bitch
A ho a ho
A woman a woman
I never did nothing
But break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence
That I'm easily peddling
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults
I'm too advanced
I lived my 20's at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like '87
Wicked as 80 Reverends
In a pool of fire with Devils holding hands
From a distance
Don't know which one is a Christian
Damn
Who can I trust in 2012
There's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help
Somebody

[Hook]
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option

[Hook]
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Hey, hey, kick her out the studio Ali

[Verse 3]
24/7, nigga working his ass for it
She popping that ass for it
The King of Diamonds with diamonds
I never do ask for it
They checking my passport
I'm too accustomed with Customs
She callin' the task force
I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me to fast-forward
The game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor
You'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4
You wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport
Her feet on the dashboard
 

[Hook]
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option

[Hook]
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga

[Outro]
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hold up
