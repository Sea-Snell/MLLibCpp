Part I — "Sing About Me"

[Produced by Like of Pac Div]

[Hook]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important My mind is really distorted I find nothin' but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction Of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright, and a fight he tried to put up But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive Everybody's a victim in my eyes When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm And outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back, whispering: "Get 'em!"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— {gunshots}


[Hook] Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it Section.80 The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it But doubted your ignorance How could you ever just put her on blast and shit? Judgin' her past and shit? Well, it's completely my future Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit And I'ma need that forty dollars Even if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park I'm followed by a married man, a father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em Back to where they used to be Then I'll probably be in the denim Of a family gene that show women how to be woman Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin' Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait…
Your rebuttal a little too late And if you have a album date Just make sure I'm not in the song, 'cause I don't need the attention: bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin' I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit!

[Hook] When the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline reekin' The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed May the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me In a direction to speak of somethin' That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between Her personal life, I was like, "It need to be told." Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and four- Fives, I count lives all on these songs Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong Fightin' for your rights even when you're wrong And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone—am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

(On the phone:) [?] "Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!" [?] "Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga." "Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back." {Hangs up} "Arghh... *fuck!* So what we gon' do, my niggas?

I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"

Part II — "I'm Dying of Thirst"

[Produced by Skhye Hutch]

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin' My own kind but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't Bring her back, who got the footage? Channel 9, cameras is lookin' It's hard to channel your energy when you know you crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (money is power)
Yours is ours (yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven To burn for eternity, return of the student That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin' Tell us to visit, we lyin' about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
And the beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is takin' notes On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, are stress days (Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—) My best days, are stress days
Say: "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' Back once my momma say: "See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works."
