[Chorus]
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

[Verse 1]
Ever since a young man
All I wanna be was a gunman
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me, aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge! Don't judge me!
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me, if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon’ see—

[Chorus]
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

[Verse 2]
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
 

[Chorus]
This what God feel like
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
This what God feel like
