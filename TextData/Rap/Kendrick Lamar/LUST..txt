[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, "It's okay."

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY]
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door in his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy— hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
(I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
 

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, "It's okay."

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings are dead — what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust
 

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
