[Hook]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Verse 1]
She got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young

[Bridge]
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So now we on, so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up

[Bridge + Hook]

[Outro]
You something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you
