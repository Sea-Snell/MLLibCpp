[Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Y-O]
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus

[Thurz]
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
I’m still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Skeme]
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it

[Brown]
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing, niggas hating, we ain’t tripping, keep our balance
 

[Hook 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
These hoes want to love me man
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm bout to make that halo burn, goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside of Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker

Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
