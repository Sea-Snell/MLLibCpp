[Intro]
I used to want to be like Michael Jordan
Figure I would make the NBA and make me a fortune

[Hook]
Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping me against the world, hello world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Michael Jordan, bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemies bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on these 26’s, I’m a vanity slave
I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper A.K.A that nigga
Don’t wuwwy! I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
This is Hiii-power since the Eddie Bauer, I’ve been popular
I’m popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come
You jocking the let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know about them hockey pucks?
Skating on ‘em, why you hating on ‘em? You should learn from ‘em
Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
I don’t know why…hey, wait a minute motherfucker

[Hook]
Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping me against the world, hello world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it
Aye, pussy crazy, pussy crazy, you fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world homie
But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
Her pussy’s crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast, call it hall of fame once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Ciroc, please, no soda pop
I make my solo pop, life’s a bitch, her pussy crazy but I make that pussy pay me

I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes

Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that…

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
I remember tripping, walking through the set like my Glock don’t think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you sucker niggas can’t see
I’m from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain
We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man
You chasing hoes, we replacing hoes, bag and pass them hoes
You brought and chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong
We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong
You know I’m gone, turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep, you left alone, you gets no fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told me Mary was a go so we passed her round and round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I’m done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy’s crazy, her pussy’s crazy, you fuck niggas

Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
