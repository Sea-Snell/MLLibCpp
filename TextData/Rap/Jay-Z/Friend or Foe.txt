[Intro]
Check one, check two
Shit, you know what to do
Primo, Cold Crush when I give it to you

[Verse]
Friend or foe, yo, state your biz
You tendin' dough? Ah, there it is
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids don't like nobody comin' around here fuckin' with they dough for shit
You enterprisin' though, and I like it
But fuck with the big dogs, yo, I gotta bite ya
Look, it's out of my hands
And you gettin' money 'round here, it's not in the plans
So hop yo' ass out of that van, head back to Kansas
I'm sendin' niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants is
Let me guess, they said it was money 'round here
And the rest is me stoppin' you from gettin' it, correct?
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll soon see
Now please give me the room key
You're twitchin', don't do that, you makin' me nervous
My crew, well, they do pack, them dudes is murderers
So please, would you put your hand back in sight?
They don't like to see me nervous
You can understand that, right?
You draw, better be Picasso—you know, the best
'Cause if this is not so, ah, God bless
You leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice
Believe you me, son
I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done
Now calm your boys, 'cause I'm findin' it
A little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point, I'll let you go; before you leave
I guess I ought to let you know, I need those keys
And a promise you never, no matter the weather
Ever ever ever ever ever ever come around here no mo'
