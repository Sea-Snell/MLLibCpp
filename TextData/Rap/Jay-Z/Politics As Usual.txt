[Intro]
You know how we do
Roc-a-Fella
Forever

[Verse 1]
You can catch me
Skating through your town, puttin' it down, y'all relatin'
No waitin', I'll make your block infrared hot: I'm like Satan
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to
Hustle behind the wheel, trying to escape my trouble
Kids stop they greeting me, I'm talking sweet to keys
Cursing the very God that brought this grief to be
My life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis
And fools that think I slip, you fuck around
You get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy
On some I-do-or-die shit, for real
The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and
Just think, Winter's here, I'm trying to feel mink nigga

[Hook]
Politics as usual

[Verse 2]
I took my Frito to Tito in the district
Blessed me with some VS
Somethings I can live with: stop fronting
And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised
No disrespect to you, make sure your word is true
I'm taking wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson
Have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off
You ain't seen money in your life, when it
Comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice
I'm smoking bros who pump Willie, I expose
The furthest you Chiles been is the Poconos
My portfolio reads: leads to Don Corleone, nigga please
10-year felon, heavy on the wrist, our face used
With the diamond flooded Jesus and blind your facials
For life, right, it's Jigga, I keep it tight nigga

[Hook]
Politics as usual

[Verse 3]
You feel my triumph never - feel my pain
I'm lying low in the leathers, I am, the best that's ever came
The game changes like my mind just ain't right
Rewind get this dough, I guess it ain't your night
Sucking me in like a vacuum, I remember
Telling my family: "I'll be back soon"; that was December
'85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later
Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot
Got matching VCR's, a huge Magnavox
Ten inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hittin' towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that
Chick baby one-two cat, yeah, I do that
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin'
The drawers from droppin', the law from watchin' - I hate 'em
Politics as usual
