[Intro - Jay-Z]
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two

[Bleek] Cocaine whiter now
[Jay-Z] Operation is sweet
[Bleek] Whole game tighter now
[Jay-Z] Moving a brick a week
[Bleek] Plus a nigga prices down
[Jay-Z] We them niggas to see
[Bleek] Time to start the arising now
[Jay-Z] I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
It seems I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit

[Memphis Bleek]
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff"
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga, whattup?"

[Hook - Memphis Bleek]
I done came up, put my life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's my time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

[Memphis Bleek]
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
That had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him

[Jay-Z]
To the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down

[Memphis Bleek]
Stay focused
I'm trying to concentrate, but it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached ("Whattup Bleek?") and I paused
 

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
You done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line
[Memphis Bleek]
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga we Lex movers, V-12 pushers

[Memphis Bleek]
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "And what?"
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennesey
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me, and my aunt saying I need 50
Not 60/40
 

[Jay-Z]
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby

[Memphis Bleek]
Your fun is my fun, your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew

[Jay-Z]
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold nigga, perfect your role

[Hook]

[Outro - Jay-Z]
Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second-in-line

Coming of Age Two, brand new
