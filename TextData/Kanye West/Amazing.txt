[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Hook: Kanye West]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Hook: Kanye West]
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Hook: Kanye West]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
I'm amazing (I'm amazing), yeah I'm all that (all that)
If I ain't on my grind then what you call that? (What you call that?)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive for victory (yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah)
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon, summertime no June
Big family small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"
 

[Outro: Kanye West]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing
