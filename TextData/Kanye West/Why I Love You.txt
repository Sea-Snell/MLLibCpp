[Hook: Mr Hudson]
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so)
(But why I love you, I'll never know)
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so)
(But why I love you, I'll never know)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Picture if you will that the throne's burning
Rome's burning and I’m sitting in the corner all alone burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don’t determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead but I’m so sorry but I just can’t die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I’ll be fly when Easter’s over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So the love is gone 'til blood is drawn
So we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

[Hook: Mr Hudson]
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so)
(But why I love you, I'll never know)
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so)
(But why I love you, I'll never know)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z (Kanye West)]
Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces before you swept on it
Goddamn this shit leaves a mess, don’t it?
Shit feelin’ like death, don’t it?
Charge it to the game, whatever’s left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly pelican fly, turn the jets on it but first I shall digress on it
Wasn’t I a good king? (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
Didn’t I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?
(Huh, I gave you my loyalty) Made you royalty and royalties
(Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees) and this is how niggas rewardin' me, damn

[Hook: Mr Hudson]
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so)
(But why I love you, I'll never know)
 

[Verse 3: Jay-Z (Kanye West)]
Bussin’ at me, b-b-b-bussin’ at me
But I’m bullet proof, bitch you can’t get nothin’ past me
Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
And I’m bussin’ back so niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turns to hate?
(Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
Caesar didn’t see it so he ceased to exist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
Am I my brother’s keeper? (Only if that nigga don’t creep up)
Got a pistol under my pillow (I’ve never been a deep sleeper)
P-p-p-paranoia
(Cause the nigga that said he’ll)
Blast for ya (is now) blastin for ya
That’s an assassin for ya (These niggas got a shot they’ll shoot)
Please Lord (forgive him) for these niggas (not know) what they do, ooh
