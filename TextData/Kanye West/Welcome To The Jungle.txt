[Intro: Swizz and (Kanye)]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
(I asked her where she wanna be when she 25
She turned around and looked at me and said “alive”)
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears
Work pots and pans, just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died, my daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that’s why I pray so hard

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que será, get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain, before it goes too far

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
My dreams is big, reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn’t make it
I’m a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep, I’m still Big Pimpin'
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun? It’s been a while
Momma, look at ya son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I’m just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn I’m so high, where the fuck did I go?
I’m losing myself, I’m stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don’t care, I’m fucking depressed
No crying in public, just lying to judges
Risking my life, I’m already dying, so fuck it well

[Outro: Swizz]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well, goddammit
