Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
All alone, swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wouldn't die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, I'm so fuckin' tired
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate

So outside of my misery, I think I'll find
A way of envisioning a better life
For the rest of us, the rest of us
There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us

Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wouldn't die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, I'm so fuckin' tired
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate
