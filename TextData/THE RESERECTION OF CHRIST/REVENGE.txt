I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
I'll rot, I'll rot, I'll rot
Is my pain your freedom?
Is all of my pain your freedom?
Enjoy…
