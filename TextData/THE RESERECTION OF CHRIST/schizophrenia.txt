Voices in your, voices in your, voices in your head
Those who tryna drive you mad
And make it all, make it all wild
(Wild)
Voices in your, voices in your, voices in your head
Those who tryna drive you mad
And make it all, make it all wild
(Wild)

There's another mind deep in me
Don't know what's gotten into me
I've seen the other side plentifully
'Til the end I'll, 'til the end I'll fight
There's another mind deep in me
Don't know what's gotten into me
I've seen the other side plentifully
'Til the end I'll, 'til the end I'll fight

[Chorus]
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
