Lost in regret, I
Feel so deeply, I can't seem to, find a means of ground
Lost in regret, I
Feel so deeply, I can't seem to, find a means of ground
Hear, regret
Say the words

Don't cry, don't cry, it won't end
Pain will always be my friend
Don't cry, don't cry
Pain will always be my friend
