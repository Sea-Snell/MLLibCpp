I put one in that chamber, lay you in the face of God
Know to be-face the fake fuck, aight
Fuck is a feelin' God, level I'm, feelin' odd
Fairily very Beverly Hill, Westside
Bitch, I'm drillin' your neighbor daughter at Best Buy
If I hit up your jack, then nigga, you best slide
If you totin' that pistol, nigga, you best ride
If you shoot that shit at me, nigga, I best die
'Cause I'm a muh'fuckin' narcissist
Trippin', you catch a fit, bitchin you not equipped with that
Pussy boy, don’t be talkin' shit
Or you can meet this AK-47, it got kick back
'Cause I’m a muhfuckin' martian, in the heart of a moshpit
Put that boy in a coffin, 'cause the way that he talkin’
Pussy boy, don’t be gawkin', I ain’t doin' no barkin'
I'ma let that shit rip, leave his ass in the parkin'
